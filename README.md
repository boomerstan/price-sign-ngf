# price-sign-ngf
Demo of front end UI for a price sign controller using AngularJS 1.4.7 and Foundation for Sites 5.3.3.

The target market was single stores or small chains marketing fuel.

I originally created this UI using AngularJS 1.4 and Foundation for Sites 5. It was embedded on a Beaglebone Black processor using lighttpd as the web server and Laravel 4 as the backend API. There was a lot more code involved for managing the signs' features, but that was proprietary knowledge. This website was intranet, never public.

This was developed prior to my discovery of John Papa's [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).
